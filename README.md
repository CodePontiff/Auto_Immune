# Auto_Immune
Project of Python Auto_Imumne

Windows Defender and other AV can be very annoying for attacker to execute malware, but how about trick them to attack the windows itself ?

So i just thinking about a python project to transform file extensions, altering their content to embed malicious PowerShell commands in the form of a reverse shell. Subsequently, the file extension is changed to .ps1 intentionally, making it readily detectable by antivirus software for removal. The overall functionality resembles an autoimmune response in the real world, wherein the body's immune system unintentionally counterattacks its own organs.
